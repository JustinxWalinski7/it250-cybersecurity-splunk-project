📌 Spring 2025

## 🔐 Project Overview
This project is for my IT 250: Fundamentals of Information Assurance and Security class. I chose the role of a **Cybersecurity Analyst** and focused on **Splunk**, a leading SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool.

## 🎯 Goal
To show how Splunk is used to:
- Analyze system logs  
- Detect suspicious activity  
- Set up alerts  
- Build dashboards for threat monitoring

## 🧪 Demo Summary
In the demo video, I show how to:
1. Upload log data into Splunk  
2. Use the search bar to find failed logins  
3. Create an alert when too many failed logins happen in a short time  
4. Build a simple dashboard to visualize login activity

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise Free Trial  
- Sample log files  
- Basic SPL (Search Processing Language) queries
